# Whiteboard

This project, once built, will be a simple interface for answering questions that might be asked in a coding interview during the dreaded whiteboarding section.

## Expected Features:

* Randomly selected questions in language of your choice
* The ability to star questions that you want to return to
* Tracking your work

## Features I definitely don't plan to build:

* Anything that checks your work
